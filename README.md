# :palm_tree: Welcome to the 2024 TROPICANA ML tutorial :palm_tree:
This repository was created for the [2024 TROPICANA workshop](https://www.institut-pascal.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/scientific-programs/tropicana)'s ML tutorial, co-led by the [UMD PARETO](https://mariajmolina.github.io/) and the [UNIL DAWN](https://wp.unil.ch/dawn/) research groups in Orsay, France.

There are two notebooks: 
1.   [ML Classification for Seasonal Tropical Cyclone Prediction using ENSO](https://github.com/tbeucler/2024_TROPICANA_ML/blob/main/ENSO_TCs_Seasonal.ipynb), co-authored by Maria J. Molina and Emily Faith Wisinski (UMD). This notebook develops and evaluates a neural network model to classify tropical cyclone frequency anomalies based on El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) data, using NOAA's Oceanic Nino Index and IBTrACS dataset, and assessing model performance using K-fold cross-validation and binary classification evaluation metrics.
2.   [ML Regression for Short-Range Tropical Cyclone Forecasting](https://github.com/tbeucler/2024_TROPICANA_ML/blob/main/Tropicana_ML_Regression.ipynb), co-authored by Tom Beucler, Milton Gomez (UNIL), and Marie McGraw (CIRA). This notebook develops linear and random forest machine learning models to forecast tropical cyclone intensity with a lead time of 24 hours, specifically focusing on maximum wind speed and minimum sea level pressure, using the SHIPS developmental and IBTrACS datasets for model training and evaluation.

One day later, we hosted an open discussion on machine learning for tropical meteorology, whose notes can be accessed [at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11wCOHzwUMlcip0qd2xhAshsIgSNm_VdgGiCiIG2TriY/edit?usp=sharing).
